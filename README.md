# Heart_Disease_predictor
A dive into understanding features driving the risk of heart disease by developing
machine learning models

Goal: To detect patterns in respondents' health conditions that could lead to heart disease

**Exploratory Data Analysis Summary**
* The classes are imbalanced in this dataset; less than 10% of the entire dataset have the
dependent variable ‘Heart Disease’ labeled as ”yes”
* There is no missing data; all the rows and columns have a valid entry
* The distributions of patients across features with and without heart diseases are similar
* There is no significant correlation between the continuous variables
